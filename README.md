# ToDo App

A simple yet effective ToDo list application built with JavaScript, Webpack, and `date-fns`. This application helps you organize your tasks into projects, set due dates and priorities, and easily manage your daily and upcoming activities.

## Features

  * **Task Management**: Create, edit, and delete tasks with a name, description, due date, and priority.
  * **Project Organization**: Group your tasks into different projects for better organization.
  * **Today's Tasks**: Quickly view all tasks due today.
  * **Upcoming Tasks**: See all tasks scheduled for future dates.
  * **Mark as Complete**: Mark tasks as done to keep track of your progress.
  * **Persistence**: All your projects and tasks are saved in local storage, so your data persists even if you close the browser.
  * **Responsive Design**: A clean and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used

  * **JavaScript**: The core logic of the application.
  * **Webpack**: For bundling the project's assets (JavaScript, CSS, images).
  * **`date-fns`**: A modern JavaScript date utility library for handling dates (formatting, comparisons).
  * **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
  * **CSS**: Styling of the application, including a clean and responsive layout.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GhulamMustafaBhatti/todo-list.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd todo-list
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the application in development mode with live reloading:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the application in your default browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized and minified files in the `dist/` directory.

### Deployment

The project includes a `deploy` script for easy deployment to GitHub Pages.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This script will:

1.  Build the project (`npm run build`).
2.  Switch to the `gh-pages` branch and merge `main` into it (`git-branch`).
3.  Force add the `dist` folder, commit the changes, and push to the `gh-pages` branch using `git subtree push` (`git-deploy`).
4.  Switch back to the `main` branch.
